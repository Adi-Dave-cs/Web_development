This project demonstrates how to create 3D text effects using CSS by stacking multiple layers of text on top of each other.

# Overview
This project showcases a visually appealing 3D text effect created entirely with CSS. By stacking layers of text and applying specific CSS properties like text-shadow, transform, and perspective, we achieve the illusion of depth and dimensionality.

# Features
3D Text Effect: The project demonstrates a realistic 3D effect, making the text appear as if it's popping out of the screen.

Layered Approach: The effect is achieved by stacking multiple layers of text and applying different styles to each layer.

# Technologies Used
- HTML
