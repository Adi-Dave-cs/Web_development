## Introduction

This project involves the use of gsap cdn for execution of smooth sequential animations.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects, follow the instructions below.

- Prerequisites
  - Node.js (v14 or higher)
  - npm or yarn
  - GSAP installation / CDN based integration

## Running the Project

    To start the development server for the selected project,
    *clone the repository* and run live server in the VS-Code or execute start index.html

## Project Structure

    1. Index.html : Root file containing the skeleton of the entire project.
    2. Index.js : Contains the code for animating different elements as desired
    3. Styles.css : Contains the styling of each element of the html

## What are the concepts involved?

    1. Gsap integration using CDN
    2. GSAP timeline for sequential execution of animations
    3. Stagger is a technique used in animations where elements animate sequentially with a small delay between each. Instead of all elements animating at once, they appear one after another, creating a smooth and natural effect.
    4. Expo.easeInOut is an easing function in GSAP (GreenSock) that creates a smooth acceleration and deceleration effect in animations. It starts slow, speeds up rapidly, and then slows down before stopping.
