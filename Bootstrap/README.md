Welcome to the README file for the Bootstrap folder where I work on practice projects. This document provides an overview of the folder, its contents, and how to get started with it.

## Overview
The Bootstrap folder is where I store and work on practice projects using the Bootstrap framework. Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites and web applications. These practice projects help me improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while leveraging the power and flexibility of Bootstrap.
