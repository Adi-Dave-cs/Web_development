# Spiderman's Portfolio

In the recent times of layoffs , our friendly neighbourhood spiderman was laid off from the Avenger's team and needs to keep working as a freelance super hero and not a full-fledged avenger.
To keep himself active and to pay his bills he needs a new job and hence this is a small attempt in making portfolio using HTML-CSS for our FRIENDLY NEIGHBBOURHOOD SPIDERMAN!!
